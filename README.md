# Money-Tracker-Assignment

The money tracker assignment is a budget-tracking application that I have built using Django and Angular. 
The application has the following features:
 - A REST API backend for creating, updating, and deleting transactions.
 - A user interface for displaying the list of transactions and allowing the user to filter the transactions by date and category.
 - The user interface displays the total amount spent and the budget remaining based on the transactions.
 
The application is built using the following tech stack:
 - Django Rest Framework to build the API
 - Angular Bootstrap to style the frontend
